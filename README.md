###### Missouri Civil War Museum

The Missouri __Civil War__ Museum is a fully recognized 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational organization. Our organization was incorporated in 2002 for the sole purpose of saving the historic Jefferson Barracks 1905 Post Exchange Building and converting it into what will become Missouri’s largest and finest Civil War museum, library, and educational center. Since our opening in June 2013, we have become one of the __largest__ Civil War Museums in the nation and will be one of the largest Civil War research libraries in the nation as well. Our focus is entirely on Missouri’s role in the American Civil War.
